      "To find the square root of 144, we can start by thinking about what a perfect square is. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer multiplied by itself.\n",

      "For example, some perfect squares are:\n",
      "\n",

    "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training conditions the model on explicit rationales during fine-tuning. Instead of teaching the model to output only the final answer, we train on (question, rationale, answer) so the model learns to internalize multi-step reasoning patterns. A practical recipe is STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner), which uses a stronger teacher model to bootstrap rationales that a smaller student can learn from.\n",
