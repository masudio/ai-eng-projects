## âœ… Guidelines
- Keep contributions **concise and relevant** to the topic.  
- Avoid uploading large datasets or proprietary materials.  
- Prefer Markdown (`.md`), text, or small HTML files for readability.  
- Include a short 1â€“2 line description for external links or references.  
- Use descriptive filenames so others can easily identify the content.
